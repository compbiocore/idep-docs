# idep-docs

## Prerequisites:

Docker

## Instructions:

Download and run the file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/compbiocore/idep-docs/master/run_idep_with_webapp.sh by invoking `bash run_idep_with_webapp.sh` in a terminal window - doing so will automatically pull a Docker image containing the iDEP webapp and data and run it.  Be sure to leave the terminal window open.

Once the application is running, simply navigate to https://localhost in a browser window to run the program.
